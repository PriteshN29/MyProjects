This XML file defines the layout for the activity\'s UI. \n It contains a TextView element with the text \"Hello world!\". app > manifests > AndroidManifest.xml. \n The manifest file describes the fundamental characteristics of the app and defines each of its components. \n Gradle Scripts > build.gradle You\'ll see two files with this name: one for the project and one for the \"app\" module. \n Each module has its own build.gradle file, but this project currently has just one module. \n You\'ll mostly work with the module\'s build.gradle file to configure how the Gradle tools compile and build your app. \n For more information about this file, see Configure Your Build.]]> \n </string>
